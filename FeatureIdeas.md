Ideas
=====

The following are some ideas to extend the tool further, help on these or new ones most welcome!

 - Ways to persist and/or recognise UML metadata (notes and annotations) from the diagrams, either as comments in the Apex classes and or as a Document in the org perhaps?
 - Wondering how we can provide ways for users to teach it to show certain UML stereo types, to recognise vf controllers, services and such like, perhaps map some styling to the stereo types?
